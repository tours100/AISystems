# AISystems

all parts have code realated to them in the swarm file, for some reason the assignment of forces on to the boids is not working I chose to go with += to add each of the forces in to the mix. apon testing I found that while the equations seemed to work there were not added to that boids information, I was not able to figure out why. so when hitting play the boids wont move.
